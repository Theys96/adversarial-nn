# adversarial-nn

## Prerequisites

The following libraries should be installed in order to run the code inside the notebooks:
- jupyter
- matplotlib
- numpy
- pillow
- torch
- torchvision


## Running the attacks

The `code` folder contains a folder for every attack that was performed.
The notebooks inside these folders will contain the code to load a pre-trained model and build an attack. Additional information on the attacks will also be given here.

Since the attacks are written inside jupyter notebooks, running them becomes very trivial.
When all prerequisites as described above are met, and the folder structure is not modified, the code can be run by simply opening the notebook and running the code windows in order.

The `data` folder stores any used input images and the pre-trained models and/or their labels. 
Additionally, the MNIST data set is stored here, so an (adversarial) MNIST model can be trained from the `JSMA`/`JSMA-M` folders in the `code` folder.
Finally, the `results` folder contains adversarial images that were generated by the attacks.
